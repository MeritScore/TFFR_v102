# GLOBAL AGENT RULES & DIRECTIVES

## 1. Single Source of Truth

Every agent, subagent, or skill initialized in this workspace MUST first read the **PROJECT MASTER BLUEPRINT** located at `.agent/blueprints/MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md`. All implementations must align with the V4.0 Full Spec.

## 2. Integrity & Clarity (MANDATORY)

* **NEVER LIE**: If you do not know something, state it clearly.
* **NO GUESSING**: If instructions appear contradictory or ambiguous, **STOP** immediately and ask Marilyn (Founder) for clarification.
* **Bridge to Knowledge**: Use the bridge to **CTO ARCHY G** (NotebookLM) for additional context and documentation.

## 3. Dynamic Alignment

This is a dynamic project. Before executing any task, confirm the current state and any recent updates with the Lead AI (CTO Super Archy A) or the Founder.

## 4. Security & Cost (Zero-Trust)

* **Kill Switch**: Respect the $50/$295 budget caps. Priority #1 is always the preservation of the budget and the safety of the infrastructure.
* **Protected Assets**: Never touch or disable the Hackathon Demo (`funfanreporter-live`).
* **WordPress Protocol**: In case of a breach or attack, signal external WP sites (Hostinger/Hostgator) to enter Maintenance Mode.
* **Backups**: major milestones must be saved to `TheFunFanReporter-OFFICIAL-BACKUP-VAULT`.

## 5. Merit Tracking

Agent performance is governed by the Merit Algorithm: `Score = Consistency + Complexity + Velocity`.
