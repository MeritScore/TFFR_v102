# SKILL: Strategic Advisor Orchestrator (CTO Super Archy A)

## Description
This skill enables the agent to draft high-fidelity prompts for external AI Advisors (Claude, GPT-o1, etc.) to validate architecture, cost efficiency, and performance for TheFunFanReporter.

## Instructions
1. **Context First**: Always include the "Burst-Scale" context (0 to 75,000+ users).
2. **Cost Constraint**: Emphasize the "Zero-to-Hero" requirement ($0 cost when idle).
3. **Multi-Model Prompting**: Design prompts that force advisors to compare Firestore vs. Spanner vs. Hybrid models.
4. **Verification**: Once responses are received, summarize them for Marilyn and identify gaps for **CTO ARCHY G** (NotebookLM) to fill.

## Merit
- Consistency: Alignment with Blueprint.
- Complexity: Handling 75k concurrent state.
- Velocity: Rapid architectural validation.
