# SECURITY COMPLIANCE POLICY

> [!CAUTION]
> **STRICT PROHIBITION: NO HARDCODED SECRETS**

## 1. Zero Tolerance for Leaks

It is strictly prohibited to commit, display, or hardcode **Sensitive Credential Data** within source code, configuration files, or documentation.

**Sensitive Data Includes:**

- API Keys (e.g., Google Cloud `AIza...`, OpenAI `sk-...`, Firebase Config)
- Authentication Tokens (JWTs, OAuth)
- Private Keys (`PRIVATE KEY`, Secrets)
- Database Passwords and Connection Strings

## 2. Mandatory Environment Protection

All Sensitive Credential Data MUST be stored exclusively in **Environment Variables** (`.env`).

- **Development:** Use `.env` (locally) and ensure it is EXPLICITLY listed in `.gitignore`.
- **Production:** Inject secrets via the platform's secure environment manager (e.g., Cloud Run Secrets, Vercel Env).

## 3. Pre-Commit Verification

Before any file creation or modification, the Agent MUST verify that:

1. Target files do not contain literal secrets.
2. `.gitignore` is properly configured to block sensitive files.

**Violation of this protocol constitutes a Critical Security Failure.**
