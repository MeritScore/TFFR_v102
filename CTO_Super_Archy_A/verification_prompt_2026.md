# VERIFICATION PROMPT FOR CTO ARCHY G (NotebookLM)

**Context**: It is January 18, 2026. We are building "TheFunFanReporter" (V4.0).
**Constraint**: $0.00 Cost when idle (Scale-to-Zero).

Please search your **2025-2026 Google Cloud & Tech Knowledge Base** to answer these critical "Tie-Breaker" questions:

1. **Spanner Serverless 2026 Status**:
    * Has Google released a true **"Scale-to-Zero"** tier for Cloud Spanner (Serverless) as of Jan 2026?
    * If yes, is the *storage* cost also zero when idle, or is there a minimum retention fee?
    * *Why this matters*: Advisors rejected Spanner because of "hourly minimums" based on 2024/2025 data. If 2026 changed this, we might switch back to Spanner.

2. **Firestore "Liquid" Limits**:
    * Are there new 2026 limits for **Firestore Native** concurrency? (Previously 10k writes/sec).
    * Is there a new "Hyper-Scale" mode for Firestore that allows higher burst writes without sharding?

3. **Cloudflare vs. Cloud Armor (Edge Integration)**:
    * Does Google Cloud 2026 offer a native "Edge Cache" managed service that rivals Cloudflare Workers, or is Cloudflare still the best partner for "Edge-First" protection?

**Output**: strictly confirm or deny the existence of these 2026 features.
